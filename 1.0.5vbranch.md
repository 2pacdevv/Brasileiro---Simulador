# What it this?
I created this branch because for not official updates, over there, we have changes that probably will be put in 1.0.5.

# Plans for 1.0.5
I have some plans for this update, I already increased one for all. Now, I will create a list with increase that can placed or removed.

1 - Bet mode

Now in the code, the user can bet in some game, choosing which team will win, if this team win, the user will earn 2x tickets that he had (Yes, I have plans for create some odds, but until now, all odds is 2x), if the user err, will lose the tickets beted

2 - New Interface

The code have a new interface for initial screen.

3 - Maybe a new language?

This is not oficial, but I think I will put a spanish like a new language, this is just a plan for now, in the future, maybe I will put this language.

4 - Correct sequence of the games

Now, the games will happen in the correct sequence, each team play only one game per round, until now, in the 1.0.4, the games ocurred in a random manner, sometimes, had teams playing 3 times or more per round, but in 1.0.5 update, this has been fixed, all teams play just one game per round, you can test this in 1.0.5 branch.

5 - Login method

Now you can make a login, with your name and your passaword, with that, if you are a new user, you will earn 100 tickets, if not, you will login with your points already obtained, all login is placed in txt, if you lose all points, you can change this txt and add tickets for you play
