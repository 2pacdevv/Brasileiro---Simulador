# What it this?
I created this branch because for not official updates, over there, we have changes that probably will be put in 1.0.5.

# When this version will be realeased?
Well, I have plans to realase in april, probaly in the second week, I still having ideas for new functions for the code and make a good simulator, but see, this realease will be the biggest of the history of the code, I never had put so much things in a only update, I can say that the update is 70% completed, but ever time when I put a new big things, kinda bet mode I need change other things of others updates, like translate all things of it, probaly after the 1.0.5 realease, I will update de code.md, explain the new code and the new interfaces, remember, if you want change anything in code, just check this md, probaly this will go help you to understand the code.

# Plans for 1.0.5
I have some plans for this update, I already increased one for all. Now, I will create a list with increase that can placed or removed.

1 - Bet mode

Now in the code, the user can bet in some game, choosing which team will win, if this team win, the user will earn 2x tickets that he had (Yes, I have plans for create some odds, but until now, all odds is 2x), if the user err, will lose the tickets beted

2 - New Interface

The code have a new interface for initial screen.

3 - Maybe a new language?

This is not oficial, but I think I will put a spanish like a new language, this is just a plan for now, in the future, maybe I will put this language.

4 - Correct sequence of the games

Now, the games will happen in the correct sequence, each team play only one game per round, until now, in the 1.0.4, the games ocurred in a random manner, sometimes, had teams playing 3 times or more per round, but in 1.0.5 update, this has been fixed, all teams play just one game per round, you can test this in 1.0.5 branch.

5 - Login method

Now you can make a login, with your name and your passaword, with that, if you are a new user, you will earn 100 tickets, if not, you will login with your points already obtained, all login is placed in txt, if you lose all points, you can change this txt and add tickets for you play

6 - New Data base

Until now, the code used to use a txt for save all datas, but now, the code use a new data base with sqlite3, I choose this because itÂ´s very easy to make in python, actually, python have a library for data base with sqlite, it make easy the all work, and with this.
The code only use this data base for users data, the games and the teams still go save in a txt.

7 - Profile Screen

The software have now, a user screen, over there, you can change select a profile photo, see the bets that you lost or win, and all bets you have made.

8 - Inspiration

Now, any team can have a inspiration and double it stats, in code I put only 1% of chance of have this, you can change with what you want in function 'simular_jogo', over there you will see the part where the inspiration is definy and the chance of it too.
All inspiration that have in simulation will appear in terminal.
