The v1.0.5 branch is created for write about the future update, Currently, I had think in a bet mode, this will work like this, the user will need put a name, like a login, after this, he going to need choose one team and bet for this team win the championship, if this team win, the user will earn some points, this points can only use for bet in another times.

# How the user can earn the first points???
I think in this manner, all time when this user run the code, earn 100 points, this is the first 100 points of the game, the user can bet in one team, if this team win, the user will earn more points, but lookk, I will create a manner of balanceting, because, some teams are strogest then others.

# Login 
Now, if the user select bet mode, you make login for use the app. The user will put a name and a password, each user need have a different name, if two user with the same name login in software, the software will recognize just one. All registrations begin with 100 tickets for bets.

# Bet mode
The bet mode is already work, but with some errors, like, if you bet in much games, probaly, the bet mode will stop, my tip is, if you want test the beta update, bet one game per round, it will work and the code donÂ´t will stop, the simulation without bet mode have some errors too, but it going to be repair.
The user can bet in how many games he want, if you lose will appaer in screen the info of the game, this will occur if win too

# New interface
If you test the code, you probalby saw the new interface, now it is more beutiful and interative, probably when the v1.0.5 is released, all the interface will have the same model of the initial screen.
