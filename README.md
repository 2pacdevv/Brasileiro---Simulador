The v1.0.5 branch is created for write about the future update, Currently, I had think in a bet mode, this will work like this, the user will need put a name, like a login, after this, he going to need choose one team and bet for this team win the championship, if this team win, the user will earn some points, this points can only use for bet in another times.

# How the user can earn the first points???
I think in this manner, all time when this user run the code, earn 100 points, this is the first 100 points of the game, the user can bet in one team, if this team win, the user will earn more points, but lookk, I will create a manner of balanceting, because, some teams are strogest then others.

# Login 
Now, if the user select bet mode, you make login for use the app. The user will put a name and a password, each user need have a different name, if two user with the same name login in software, the software will recognize just one. All registrations begin with 100 tickets for bets.
